Hints:
- In the A6 (4F) there are 2 different countries groupings that come into effect in the case of maintenance interval settings.
- The service interval channels should be adjusted in the following order: 45> 43> 42> 44> 49 or 45> 42> 43> 49> 44.

Countries Group 1 (flexible maintenance interval): Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Great Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Canary Islands, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Malta, Austria, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland / Lichtenstein, Spain / Andorra, Czech Republic, Cyprus

Countries Group 2 (fixed maintenance interval): Canada and USA, Poland, Turkey, New Zealand, Australia, China, CIS (excluding the Baltic States, Ukraine, Belarus), Special Requirement South America (excluding Argentina, Brazil, Chile), Romania, Chile, Special Requirement Middle East (Jordan, Syria, Lebanon), Special Requirement Middle East (Iraq, Afganistan), Special Requirement Africa (Excluding North / South Africa), South Africa, Special Requirement North Africa (Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia), Special requirements Brunei, Albania, Macedonia, Argentina, Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Dubai

-> channel 02 (service interval display)
To reset, enter "00000" and save the value.

-> channel 03 (consumption display)
The base value is 100 now you can set the whole in 1% steps, the respective maximum values are 85 (%) and 115 (%).

-> channel 09 (odometer)
The values indicate the distance to be displayed later in the KM counter (eg 11356 for a KM level of 113,560km).
Before the instrument cluster accepts the new KM version, a login must be made with "13861".

-> channel 19 (radio clock)
The adjustment of the synchronization time for the radio clock takes place in minutes, the value 0 corresponds to the status no radio clock installed.
Value range: 0 - 50 minutes

-> Channel 29 (tank sensor characteristic 2) (Quattro only)
The base value is 128 now you can set in 1er steps, this corresponds to 1/4 liter. The respective maximum values are 120 and 136, respectively. The parallel shift of the fuel sender characteristic curve takes place over the entire range.

-> channel 30 (tank sensor characteristic 1)
The base value is 128 now you can set in 1er steps, this corresponds to 1/4 liter. The respective maximum values are 120 and 136, respectively. The parallel shift of the fuel sender characteristic curve takes place over the entire range.

-> channel 31 (wet calibration)
Adjustment of the tank contents at the first filling on the belt. This value is used for correction. After the ignition is switched on for the first time, the instrument cluster corrects the tank sensor resistance to the liter value specified in this channel.

-> channel 32 (dead volume)
Adjustment of the volume not detected by the fuel gauge. This must be done before the first filling in channel 31.

-> channel 33 (adjustment)
Adjustment of the upper half of the fuel gauge curve, this is stretched or shrunk. The base value is 128 and can be negotiated in 1 ohm increments between 112 and 144. To start the correction, enter 65535 as the first adjustment value.

-> channel 35 (adjustment of the speed threshold)
The adaptation value 0 corresponds to a factory-set oil pressure warning if the oil pressure falls below 1.2 bar at a speed of 1500 rpm. The adaptation can be done in steps of 250 (0 - 1000).
0000 - 1000 rpm
0250 - 1750 rpm
0500 - 2000 rpm
0750 - 2250 rpm
1000 - 2500 rpm

-> channel 38 (oilmin warning)
Adjustment of oilmin warning at low oil level. Before the setting, you must log in with 13861.
0 - deactivated
1 - activated

-> Channel 39 (TOG sensor)
This channel determines whether the temperature and oil level sender (TOG) is installed in the instrument cluster. Before the setting, you must log in with 13861.

0 - deactivated (not installed in the instrument cluster)
1 - activated (installed in the instrument cluster)

-> Channel 40 (driven lane since last service)
The input of the respective setpoint is only possible in steps of 100 km, thus the display is also shown.

-> Channel 41 (time since last service)
The input of the respective setpoint is only possible in steps of days, thus the indication in the display takes place in days.

-> Channel 42 (minimum km mileage)
The indication takes place in 100km (150x100 = 15.000km).

080 - fixed maintenance interval (8,000 km / 5,000 miles)
150 - flexible maintenance interval (15.000km)

-> Channel 46 (total consumption) (petrol only)
The value stated in liters does not represent the actual consumption, but a calculation value for the service display from various engine data and mileage.

-> Channel 47 (soot entry) (diesel only)
The value indicated represents a comparison value for the service indicator. The displayed value is a calculated value for the soot content in engine oil, based on a distance of 100 km.

-> Channel 48 (thermal load) (diesel only)
The specified value represents a comparison value for the service indicator. The displayed value is a calculated value for the thermal load in the engine oil, based on a distance of 100 km.

-> channel 49 (minimum time interval)
The time is given in days.
365 - fixed maintenance interval (all group 2 countries)
